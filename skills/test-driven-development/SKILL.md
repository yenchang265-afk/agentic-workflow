# Test-Driven Development

## Overview

Write a failing test before writing the code that makes it pass. For bug fixes, reproduce the bug with a test before attempting a fix. Tests are proof — "seems right" is not done. A codebase with good tests is an AI agent's superpower; a codebase without tests is a liability.

## When to Use

- Implementing any new logic or behavior
- Fixing any bug (the Prove-It Pattern)
- Modifying existing functionality
- Adding edge case handling
- Any change that could break existing behavior

**When NOT to use:** Pure configuration changes, documentation updates, or static content changes that have no behavioral impact.

**Related:** For browser-based changes, combine TDD with runtime verification — see `browser-testing-with-devtools`.

## The TDD Cycle

```
    RED                GREEN              REFACTOR
 Write a test    Write minimal code    Clean up the
 that fails  ──→  to make it pass  ──→  implementation  ──→  (repeat)
      │                  │                    │
      ▼                  ▼                    ▼
   Test FAILS        Test PASSES         Tests still PASS
```

### Step 1: RED — Write a Failing Test

Write the test first. It must fail. A test that passes immediately proves nothing.

```typescript
// RED: This test fails because createTask doesn't exist yet
describe('TaskService', () => {
  it('creates a task with title and default status', async () => {
    const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });

    expect(task.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(task.title).toBe('Buy groceries');
    expect(task.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(task.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });
});
```

### Step 2: GREEN — Make It Pass

Write the minimum code to make the test pass. Don't over-engineer:

```typescript
// GREEN: Minimal implementation
export async function createTask(input: { title: string }): Promise<Task> {
  const task = {
    id: generateId(),
    title: input.title,
    status: 'pending' as const,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  };
  await db.tasks.insert(task);
  return task;
}
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR — Clean Up

With tests green, improve the code without changing behavior:

- Extract shared logic
- Improve naming
- Remove duplication
- Optimize if necessary

Run tests after every refactor step to confirm nothing broke.

## The Prove-It Pattern (Bug Fixes)

When a bug is reported, **do not start by trying to fix it.** Start by writing a test that reproduces it.

```
Bug report arrives
       │
       ▼
  Write a test that demonstrates the bug
       │
       ▼
  Test FAILS (confirming the bug exists)
       │
       ▼
  Implement the fix
       │
       ▼
  Test PASSES (proving the fix works)
       │
       ▼
  Run full test suite (no regressions)
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// Bug: "Completing a task doesn't update the completedAt timestamp"

// Step 1: Write the reproduction test (it should FAIL)
it('sets completedAt when task is completed', async () => {
  const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Test' });
  const completed = await taskService.completeTask(task.id);

  expect(completed.status).toBe('completed');
  expect(completed.completedAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);  // This fails → bug confirmed
});

// Step 2: Fix the bug
export async function completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task> {
  return db.tasks.update(id, {
    status: 'completed',
    completedAt: new Date(),  // This was missing
  });
}

// Step 3: Test passes → bug fixed, regression guarded
```

## The Test Pyramid

Invest testing effort according to the pyramid — most tests should be small and fast, with progressively fewer tests at higher levels:

```
          ╱╲
         ╱  ╲         E2E Tests (~5%)
        ╱    ╲        Full user flows, real browser
       ╱──────╲
      ╱        ╲      Integration Tests (~15%)
     ╱          ╲     Component interactions, API boundaries
    ╱────────────╲
   ╱              ╲   Unit Tests (~80%)
  ╱                ╲  Pure logic, isolated, milliseconds each
 ╱──────────────────╲
```

**The Beyonce Rule:** If you liked it, you should have put a test on it. Infrastructure changes, refactoring, and migrations are not responsible for catching your bugs — your tests are. If a change breaks your code and you didn't have a test for it, that's on you.

### Test Sizes (Resource Model)

Beyond the pyramid levels, classify tests by what resources they consume:

| Size | Constraints | Speed | Example |
|------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Small** | Single process, no I/O, no network, no database | Milliseconds | Pure function tests, data transforms |
| **Medium** | Multi-process OK, localhost only, no external services | Seconds | API tests with test DB, component tests |
| **Large** | Multi-machine OK, external services allowed | Minutes | E2E tests, performance benchmarks, staging integration |

Small tests should make up the vast majority of your suite. They're fast, reliable, and easy to debug when they fail.

### Decision Guide

```
Is it pure logic with no side effects?
  → Unit test (small)

Does it cross a boundary (API, database, file system)?
  → Integration test (medium)

Is it a critical user flow that must work end-to-end?
  → E2E test (large) — limit these to critical paths
```

## Writing Good Tests

Worked examples for every rule live in `references/testing-patterns.md`:

- **Test state, not interactions.** Assert on the outcome of an operation, never on which methods were called — interaction tests break under refactor even when behavior is unchanged.
- **DAMP over DRY.** A test reads like a specification: self-contained and descriptive, with duplication acceptable when it keeps each test independently understandable.
- **Prefer real implementations** — then fakes, then stubs, then mocks (sparingly). Mock only at boundaries where the real dependency is slow, non-deterministic, or side-effectful.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** structure in every test.
- **One assertion-concept per test**, named for the behavior it verifies ("sets completedAt when task is completed" — never "works").

Anti-patterns (flaky tests, snapshot abuse, over-mocking, shared state) are catalogued in `references/testing-patterns.md` → Test Anti-Patterns.

## When to Use Subagents for Testing

For complex bug fixes, spawn a subagent to write the reproduction test:

```
Main agent: "Spawn a subagent to write a test that reproduces this bug:
[bug description]. The test should fail with the current code."

Subagent: Writes the reproduction test

Main agent: Verifies the test fails, then implements the fix,
then verifies the test passes.
```

This separation ensures the test is written without knowledge of the fix, making it more robust.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll write tests after the code works" | You won't. And tests written after the fact test implementation, not behavior. |
| "This is too simple to test" | Simple code gets complicated. The test documents the expected behavior. |
| "Tests slow me down" | Tests slow you down now. They speed you up every time you change the code later. |
| "I tested it manually" | Manual testing doesn't persist. Tomorrow's change might break it with no way to know. |
| "The code is self-explanatory" | Tests ARE the specification. They document what the code should do, not what it does. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production code. Tests from day one prevent the "test debt" crisis. |

## Red Flags

- Writing code without any corresponding tests
- Tests that pass on the first run (they may not be testing what you think)
- "All tests pass" but no tests were actually run
- Bug fixes without reproduction tests
- Tests that test framework behavior instead of application behavior
- Test names that don't describe the expected behavior
- Skipping tests to make the suite pass

## Verification

After completing any implementation:

- [ ] Every new behavior has a corresponding test
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Bug fixes include a reproduction test that failed before the fix
- [ ] Test names describe the behavior being verified
- [ ] No tests were skipped or disabled
- [ ] Coverage hasn't decreased (if tracked)

One clean run per code state — see `references/definition-of-done.md` → Verification Discipline.
