# Performance Optimization

## Overview

Measure before optimizing. Performance work without measurement is guessing — and guessing leads to premature optimization that adds complexity without improving what matters. Profile first, identify the actual bottleneck, fix it, measure again. Optimize only what measurements prove matters.

## When to Use

- Performance requirements exist in the spec (load time budgets, response time SLAs)
- Users or monitoring report slow behavior
- Core Web Vitals scores are below thresholds
- You suspect a change introduced a regression
- Building features that handle large datasets or high traffic

**When NOT to use:** Don't optimize before you have evidence of a problem. Premature optimization adds complexity that costs more than the performance it gains.

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

## The Optimization Workflow

```
1. MEASURE  → Establish baseline with real data
2. IDENTIFY → Find the actual bottleneck (not assumed)
3. FIX      → Address the specific bottleneck
4. VERIFY   → Measure again, confirm improvement
5. GUARD    → Add monitoring or tests to prevent regression
```

### Step 1: Measure

Two complementary approaches — use both:

- **Synthetic (Lighthouse, DevTools Performance tab):** Controlled conditions, reproducible. Best for CI regression detection and isolating specific issues.
- **RUM (web-vitals library, CrUX):** Real user data in real conditions. Required to validate that a fix actually improved user experience.

**Frontend:**
```bash
# Synthetic: Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools (or CI)
# Chrome DevTools → Performance tab → Record
# Chrome DevTools MCP → Performance trace

# RUM: Web Vitals library in code
import { onLCP, onINP, onCLS } from 'web-vitals';

onLCP(console.log);
onINP(console.log);
onCLS(console.log);
```

**Backend:**
```bash
# Response time logging
# Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
# Database query logging with timing

# Simple timing
console.time('db-query');
const result = await db.query(...);
console.timeEnd('db-query');
```

### Where to Start Measuring

Use the symptom to decide what to measure first:

```
What is slow?
├── First page load
│   ├── Large bundle? --> Measure bundle size, check code splitting
│   ├── Slow server response? --> Measure TTFB in DevTools Network waterfall
│   │   ├── DNS long? --> Add dns-prefetch / preconnect for known origins
│   │   ├── TCP/TLS long? --> Enable HTTP/2, check edge deployment, keep-alive
│   │   └── Waiting (server) long? --> Profile backend, check queries and caching
│   └── Render-blocking resources? --> Check network waterfall for CSS/JS blocking
├── Interaction feels sluggish
│   ├── UI freezes on click? --> Profile main thread, look for long tasks (>50ms)
│   ├── Form input lag? --> Check re-renders, controlled component overhead
│   └── Animation jank? --> Check layout thrashing, forced reflows
├── Page after navigation
│   ├── Data loading? --> Measure API response times, check for waterfalls
│   └── Client rendering? --> Profile component render time, check for N+1 fetches
└── Backend / API
    ├── Single endpoint slow? --> Profile database queries, check indexes
    ├── All endpoints slow? --> Check connection pool, memory, CPU
    └── Intermittent slowness? --> Check for lock contention, GC pauses, external deps
```

### Step 2: Identify the Bottleneck

Common bottlenecks by category:

**Frontend:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Slow LCP | Large images, render-blocking resources, slow server | Check network waterfall, image sizes |
| High CLS | Images without dimensions, late-loading content, font shifts | Check layout shift attribution |
| Poor INP | Heavy JavaScript on main thread, large DOM updates | Check long tasks in Performance trace |
| Slow initial load | Large bundle, many network requests | Check bundle size, code splitting |

**Backend:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Slow API responses | N+1 queries, missing indexes, unoptimized queries | Check database query log |
| Memory growth | Leaked references, unbounded caches, large payloads | Heap snapshot analysis |
| CPU spikes | Synchronous heavy computation, regex backtracking | CPU profiling |
| High latency | Missing caching, redundant computation, network hops | Trace requests through the stack |

### Step 3: Fix Common Anti-Patterns

#### N+1 Queries (Backend)

```typescript
// BAD: N+1 — one query per task for the owner
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany();
for (const task of tasks) {
  task.owner = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: task.ownerId } });
}

// GOOD: Single query with join/include
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany({
  include: { owner: true },
});
```

#### Unbounded Data Fetching

```typescript
// BAD: Fetching all records
const allTasks = await db.tasks.findMany();

// GOOD: Paginated with limits
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany({
  take: 20,
  skip: (page - 1) * 20,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
});
```

#### Other Common Anti-Patterns

Rules — worked examples for each live in `references/performance-checklist.md` → Implementation Examples:

- **Images**: every `<img>` ships explicit dimensions; hero/LCP images get `fetchpriority="high"` with AVIF/WebP `srcset`; below-the-fold images get `loading="lazy" decoding="async"`.
- **Re-renders (React)**: stable references for props (hoist constants, `useMemo` expensive computations, `React.memo` expensive components — and only those).
- **Bundle size**: route-level `lazy()` + `Suspense` for heavy, rarely-used features; profile before changing import styles — modern bundlers already tree-shake ESM.
- **Caching (backend)**: TTL-cache frequently-read rarely-changed data; immutable `Cache-Control` for hashed static assets; explicit `max-age` on cacheable API responses.

## Performance Budget

Set budgets and enforce them:

```
JavaScript bundle: < 200KB gzipped (initial load)
CSS: < 50KB gzipped
Images: < 200KB per image (above the fold)
Fonts: < 100KB total
API response time: < 200ms (p95)
Time to Interactive: < 3.5s on 4G
Lighthouse Performance score: ≥ 90
```

**Enforce in CI:**
```bash
# Bundle size check
npx bundlesize --config bundlesize.config.json

# Lighthouse CI
npx lhci autorun
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We'll optimize later" | Performance debt compounds. Fix obvious anti-patterns now, defer micro-optimizations. |
| "It's fast on my machine" | Your machine isn't the user's. Profile on representative hardware and networks. |
| "This optimization is obvious" | If you didn't measure, you don't know. Profile first. |
| "Users won't notice 100ms" | Research shows 100ms delays impact conversion rates. Users notice more than you think. |
| "The framework handles performance" | Frameworks prevent some issues but can't fix N+1 queries or oversized bundles. |

## Red Flags

- Optimization without profiling data to justify it
- N+1 query patterns in data fetching
- List endpoints without pagination
- Images without dimensions, lazy loading, or responsive sizes
- Bundle size growing without review
- No performance monitoring in production
- `React.memo` and `useMemo` everywhere (overusing is as bad as underusing)

## Verification

After any performance-related change:

- [ ] Before and after measurements exist (specific numbers)
- [ ] The specific bottleneck is identified and addressed
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are within "Good" thresholds
- [ ] Bundle size hasn't increased significantly
- [ ] No N+1 queries in new data fetching code
- [ ] Performance budget passes in CI (if configured)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (optimization didn't break behavior)
