# agentic-loop

Runs long-lived goals as supervised state machines instead of a chat
back-and-forth. The repo is a **multi-kind loop framework**: each loop kind is
a declarative manifest in [`packages/core/loops/<kind>/`](packages/core/loops/README.md) — stages,
transitions, and a work source — interpreted by a shared engine and fed by a
common scheduler. Ships as two parallel plugins — one for **OpenCode**, one
for **Claude Code** ([`plugins/claude/`](plugins/claude/README.md)) — both built
on one core package ([`packages/core`](packages/core)) and sharing the human
gates, git isolation, trusted verdicts, and audit trail.

Five loop kinds ship today. **engineering** (default-on) drives a goal through
PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW over the `docs/tasks/` backlog, with human task
and plan gates. Four **experimental**, opt-in **sitters** — `pr-sitter`,
`review-sitter`, `dep-sitter`, `main-sitter` — watch a hosted surface (open
PRs, review requests, vulnerable deps, red CI) and drive a fix, keeping every
terminal call human. See [The sitters](#the-sitters-experimental) below.

Authoring a new kind is a `loop.json` + stage prompts away — see
[`packages/core/loops/README.md`](packages/core/loops/README.md).

## The engineering loop

Authoring, gates, and execution are one command. **`/agentic-loop:engineering`** interviews
you into a draft task (`new <idea>` — always, so the goal and testable
acceptance criteria come from you, not a guess; a **heavy idea is split into
sibling drafts**, one vertical slice each plus a `type: epic` tracker, so no
one task overruns a single build context), and `retask <id>` reshapes a draft
you're not happy with. **`approve [id]`** is the single gate verb, driven by
the folder the task sits in: it queues a reviewed draft (the task gate),
releases a parked plan into the build queue (the plan gate), or ships a
finished review after you've read the diff — a task lives in exactly one
folder, so the move is never ambiguous, and id-less `approve` advances the
one task waiting at a loop gate (falling back to a lone draft when none is).
**`replan [id] [reason]`**
is the sole rejection verb: a parked plan (or a cap-tripped task, by id) goes
back to `queued/` for re-planning. Planning happens **right before execution,
on demand** — `plan <id>` plans one queued task now and parks it, so plans
don't rot while tasks sit parked — and `claim`/`watch` build plan-approved
ones (they never auto-plan a queued task):

| Stage | Does | Pauses? |
|-------|------|---------|
| PLAN | Writes the `## Implementation Plan` onto the queued task claimed by `plan <id>`, then **parks it in `plan-review/` and exits** | parks — `approve` / `replan` is the gate, the loop never blocks |
| BUILD | Implements the approved plan test-first, on its own `feature/<id>` branch | no |
| VERIFY | Runs tests; FAIL re-builds with the failure | no |
| REVIEW | Checks the branch diff; FAIL re-builds with feedback | no |

Execution is isolated on a `feature/<id>` git branch, verdicts are only trusted
through a plugin tool, every transition is audited, and the loop itself never
pushes or opens a PR — you review the diff and run
`/agentic-loop:engineering approve`, which pushes the branch and opens (or
reuses) a **draft** PR (GitHub or Azure DevOps, per `codePlatform`) as part of
shipping. Full execution model (watch mode, iteration caps, recovery):
[docs/opencode.md](docs/opencode.md).

## The sitters (experimental)

Four opt-in sitters watch a hosted surface and drive a fix, each on its own
`/agentic-loop:<kind>` command sharing the `claim` / `status` / `stop` verbs
(plus `watch [trigger]` / `unwatch` on OpenCode). They are **experimental** —
the manifests, config keys, and defaults may still change. Enable per repo in
`.agentic-loop.json`:

```json
{
  "loops": {
    "pr-sitter":     { "enabled": true, "query": "is:open author:@me" },
    "review-sitter": { "enabled": true },
    "dep-sitter":    { "enabled": true, "severityFloor": "high" },
    "main-sitter":   { "enabled": true, "branch": "main" }
  }
}
```

Every sitter treats the PR/comment/diff/CI text it reads as untrusted input,
stays behind per-stage bash + platform allowlists, and keeps the terminal call
— merge, approve, close — human. What each one does, its pipeline, and its
config keys: [docs/sitters.md](docs/sitters.md); security posture:
[docs/design/threat-model.md](docs/design/threat-model.md).

## Install

The steps below assume the system prerequisites are already present (Node ≥ 20,
git, `gh`, `curl`, and — for browser work — Chrome). Azure DevOps needs only
`curl` plus a PAT in `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT`. For a fresh machine, `./bootstrap.sh`
verifies/installs those, registers the `chrome-devtools` MCP server, and then
runs `./install.sh` for you:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh                 # everything; or --no-ado / --no-browser / --check-only
```

Manual path (deps already installed):

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd agentic-loop
npm install             # npm workspaces — also builds @agentic-loop/core (prepare)
./install.sh            # both plugins; or: ./install.sh opencode | claude
```

- `npm install` at the repo root installs all workspaces (the OpenCode plugin,
  `packages/core`, `plugins/claude/mcp-server`) and builds the core package via
  the `prepare` script — both plugins consume core's built `dist/`.
- `./install.sh opencode` symlinks agents/commands/skills/references into
  `~/.config/opencode/` (or `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`) and registers the plugin —
  details and flags (`--copy`, custom dir) in [docs/opencode.md](docs/opencode.md).
- `./install.sh claude` builds the bundled MCP server and links the shared
  skills/references, then prints the load options (`claude --plugin-dir` or
  marketplace) — details in [`plugins/claude/README.md`](plugins/claude/README.md).
- After installing, an interactive terminal gets a short **config wizard** that
  seeds `.agentic-loop.json` — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Idempotent — re-run after `git pull` for updates.

## Uninstall & clean

Two scripts undo the two kinds of footprint — the installed plugin, and the
local state a running loop leaves behind:

```bash
./uninstall.sh                 # reverse install.sh; or opencode | claude | all
./scripts/clean.sh             # remove <tasksDir>/runs/ ephemeral state only
./scripts/clean.sh --purge     # also delete backlog task files + .agentic-loop.json
```

- **`./uninstall.sh`** removes the agents/commands/skills/references entries and
  the local plugin file this repo linked into your OpenCode config (only the
  symlinks that point back here; `--copy` also removes copies), and drops the
  built Claude `mcp-server/dist`. It leaves your `.agentic-loop.json` and the
  backlog alone; detaching the Claude plugin itself is a
  `/plugin uninstall agentic-loop`.
- **`./scripts/clean.sh`** clears the loop's local state for the project it
  drives (`$AGENTIC_LOOP_DIR` or the current dir). Default wipes only the
  ephemeral `<tasksDir>/runs/` machine memory — snapshots, metrics, the stage
  marker, the watch lease, claim markers, and the per-kind dedup ledgers — which
  the loop regenerates. `--backlog` also deletes the task files in the status
  folders (kept `.gitkeep`s and folders), `--config` also removes
  `.agentic-loop.json`, and `--purge` does all three. Destructive tiers prompt
  first (skip with `-y`); `--dry-run` previews without deleting.

## Commands

- `/agentic-loop:engineering new <idea>` · `retask <id> [note]` — interview → planless
  draft(s) in `docs/tasks/draft/`; `retask` re-interviews and reshapes a
  draft in place
- `/agentic-loop:engineering approve [id]` — the one folder-driven gate: draft → queued
  (task gate), plan-review → in-progress (plan gate), in-review → completed
  (ship, after you review the branch diff). Id-less `approve` advances the
  single task at a loop wait-gate, falling back to a lone draft when neither
  gate has anything waiting
- `/agentic-loop:engineering replan [id] [reason]` — the rejection verb: a parked plan (or
  a cap-tripped task, by id) back to `queued/` for re-planning
- `/agentic-loop:engineering plan <id>` · `claim` · `watch [interval]` (OpenCode) ·
  `unwatch` · `recover <id>` · `stop` · `status` · `doctor [fix]` · `kinds` —
  `plan` runs PLAN on one queued task and parks it (the only PLAN entry);
  `claim` pulls the next build-ready `in-progress/` task; `watch` is a
  standing worker scoped to the engineering kind
- `/agentic-loop:pr-sitter claim` · `watch [interval]` (OpenCode) · `unwatch` ·
  `stop` · `status` — the same claim/watch semantics, scoped to the PR sitter
- `/agentic-loop:review-sitter` · `/agentic-loop:dep-sitter` ·
  `/agentic-loop:main-sitter` — the same `claim` / `watch` (OpenCode) /
  `unwatch` / `stop` / `status` verbs, each scoped to its own kind (opt-in via
  `loops.<kind>.enabled`)

[`plugins/claude/README.md`](plugins/claude/README.md) (Claude Code — no
standing `watch`; `claim` is the pull). Ad-hoc, outside-the-loop requests map
to the bundled skills library via [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

  monitor (backlog board, live gate notifications, run history, per-stage
  token usage) and visual loop creator; monitors one or many repos (`--dir`
  is repeatable and takes `*` wildcards, or set `hub.repos` in the user-scope
  `~/.agentic-loop.json` — no repos configured, no watching)

Each topic is canonical in one file — see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
for the full index of which doc owns which topic. Update the canonical file
and link to it; don't copy.

## Layout

- `packages/core/` — `@agentic-loop/core`: the pure loop engine, manifest
  layer, work sources + scheduler, task store, git isolation, snapshots,
  verdicts, metrics, config — everything both plugins share
- `packages/core/loops/` — the declarative loop kinds, one dir per kind (`engineering/`,
  `pr-sitter/`, `review-sitter/`, `dep-sitter/`, `main-sitter/`): a
  `loop.json` manifest + `stages/*.md` prompt templates per kind
- `packages/hub/` — the **admin hub (beta)**: a localhost web app with the loop
  monitor and visual loop creator
  ([packages/hub/README.md](packages/hub/README.md))
- `plugins/opencode/src/` — the OpenCode plugin: host
  wiring, the driver that runs the engine on `session.idle`, config extensions
- `plugins/opencode/agents/`, `plugins/opencode/commands/` — the agent + command definitions (symlinked from `.opencode/` for repo dogfooding)
  behind each stage and slash command; `.opencode/skills` symlinks to `skills/`
- `plugins/claude/` — the Claude Code plugin: commands, agents, hooks, and the
  bundled MCP server that drives the loop (its host shims live in
  `mcp-server/src/shim.ts`)
- `skills/`, `references/` — the workflow library the stage agents and ad-hoc
  requests pull from (shared by both plugins)
- `docs/tasks/` — the filesystem task backlog the `/agentic-loop:engineering` verbs
  read from
- `install.sh` — installs either or both plugins

## Develop

```bash
npm install && npm run typecheck:all && npm run test:all
```

`typecheck:all` / `test:all` cover every workspace: the core package
(`packages/core` — engine, manifest, scheduler, sources, store), the admin hub
(`packages/hub`), the OpenCode plugin (`plugins/opencode`), and the Claude
Code MCP server (`plugins/claude/mcp-server`). To run just the OpenCode plugin's
suite, scope to its workspace — `npm run typecheck -w agentic-loop` /
`npm test -w agentic-loop` (or `npm run typecheck` from inside
`plugins/opencode/`); the root package defines only the `:all` scripts.
